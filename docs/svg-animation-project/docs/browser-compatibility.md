# Browser Compatibility for SVG Animations

This document provides information on the compatibility of SVG animations across different web browsers, specifically focusing on Firefox and Safari.

## Supported Browsers

### Firefox
- SVG animations are fully supported in the latest versions of Firefox.
- CSS animations and transitions work seamlessly with SVG elements.
- JavaScript-based animations using the `requestAnimationFrame` method are also supported.

### Safari
- SVG animations are supported in Safari, but there may be some limitations with older versions.
- CSS animations and transitions are generally well-supported, but ensure to test on various versions.
- JavaScript-based animations are compatible, but performance may vary depending on the complexity of the animation.

## Recommendations for Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Use CSS animations for simpler animations as they tend to have better performance and compatibility.
- For complex animations, consider using JavaScript with fallbacks for older browsers.
- Always test your SVG animations in multiple browsers and versions to ensure consistent behavior.

## Polyfills
- To enhance SVG compatibility in older browsers, include the `svg-polyfill.js` file in your project. This will help ensure that SVGs render correctly even in browsers that do not fully support SVG features.

## Conclusion
By following the guidelines above and utilizing the provided polyfills, you can create SVG animations that work effectively across Firefox, Safari, and other modern browsers. Always keep your browser versions updated to take advantage of the latest features and improvements in SVG support.
